# MLOps Fundamentals

### Environments
1. Dev – can be accessed by people –no guarantee of quality – low risk
2. Stage - can be accessed by subset of people – test of dev code –
quality is matched with prod – treated as a live product
3. Prod – Very least number of people has access (tight control on
access) – Live Product –highest quality in assets – business critical

- Models – Model & Model Artifacts with Model Registry
- Data – Separate environments for storage.
